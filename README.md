## How To Run
Install mongodb locally on your computer using this [guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) from the official documentation.

This app was developed on a macOS device but should also work on Windows and Linux.

Make sure the mongodb server is on before running the following commands

Start backend:
```
cd app/server
npm install
npm start
```

Start frontend:
```
cd app/client
npm install
npm start
```
